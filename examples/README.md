# Airlock Gateway REST API Example Scripts

This repository contains a set of example scripts for interacting with the Airlock Gateway REST API. The provided scripts demonstrate various functionalities such as managing IP address lists and handling deny rule exceptions. Please note that each script is intended solely as an example and is provided "as is" without any warranty or official support.

The scripts are not part of the official Airlock product delivery, and Ergon/Airlock does not provide support for them. Best-effort support may be provided by the contributor(s) of the scripts.

As the name of the directory suggests, these scripts are **examples**. They are independent of one another, may vary in coding style and quality, and should serve as a starting point for your own customizations.

**Your use of any script is at your own risk and without warranty of any kind.**


For the package imports in the examples to work properly run the module as a script from outside the repository e.g.
```
python3 -m airlock_gateway_rest_api_lib.examples.enable_deny_rule_group
```
