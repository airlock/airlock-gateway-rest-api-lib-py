# Airlock Gateway REST API Example Scripts

This repository contains a set of example scripts for interacting with the Airlock Gateway REST API. The provided scripts demonstrate various functionalities such as managing IP address lists and handling deny rule exceptions. Please note that each script is intended solely as an example and is provided "as is" without any warranty or official support.

**Your use of any script is at your own risk and without warranty of any kind.**

The scripts are not part of the official Airlock product delivery, and Ergon/Airlock does not provide support for them. Best-effort support may be provided by the contributor(s) of the scripts.

As the name of the repository suggests, these scripts are **examples**. They are independent of one another, may vary in coding style and quality, and should serve as a starting point for your own customizations.


## Requirements

The scripts use a Python library for interacting with Airlock Gateway's REST API. This library is available at:

Ensure the library is placed in the directory `airlock_gateway_rest_api_lib` by running:
